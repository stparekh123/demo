# $Id$
#
# Perforce review daemon
#
# This script emails descriptions of new changelists and/or new or modified
# jobs to users who have expressed an interest in them.  Users express
# interest in reviewing changes and/or jobs by setting the "Reviews:" field
# on their user form (see "p4 help user").  Users are notified of changes
# if they review any file involved in that change. Users are notified of
# job updates if they review "//depot/jobs". (This value is configurable
# - see the <jobpath> configuration variable, below).
#
# If run directly with the <repeat> configuration variable = 1, the script
# will sleep for "sleeptime" seconds and then run again.  On UNIX you can
# run the script from cron by setting <repeat> = 0 and adding the following
# line to the cron table with "crontab -e:"
#
#        * * * * * /path/to/p4review.py
#
# This will run the script every minute.  Note that if you use cron you
# should be sure that the script will complete within the time allotted.
#
# The CONFIGURATION VARIABLES below should be examined and in some
# cases changed.
#
#
# Common errors and debugging tips:
#
# -> Error: "command not found" (Windows) or "name: not found" (UNIX) errors.
#
#     - On Windows, check that "p4" is on your PATH or set:
#       p4='"c:/program files/perforce/p4"' (or to the appropriate path).
#       (NOTE the use of " inside the string to prevent interpretation of
#       the command as "run c:/program with arguments files/perforce/p4...")
#
#     - On UNIX, set p4='/usr/local/bin/p4' (or to the appropriate path)
#
# -> Error: "You don't have permission for this operation"
#
#     - Check that the user you set os.environ['P4USER'] to (see below)
#       has "review" or "super" permission via "p4 protect".
#       This user should be able to run "p4 -u username counter test 42"
#       (this sets the value of a counter named "test" to 42)
#
# -> Error: "Unable to connect to SMTP host"
#
#     - check that the mailhost is set correctly - try "telnet mailhost 25"
#       and see if you connect to an SMTP server.  Type "quit" to exit
#
# -> Problem: The review daemon seems to run but you don't get email
#
#     - check the output of "p4 counters" - you should see a counter named
#       "review"
#     - check the output of "p4 reviews -c changenum" for a recent change;
#       if no one is reviewing the change then no email will be sent.
#       Check the setting of "Reviews:" on the user form with "p4 user"
#     - check that your email address is set correctly on the user form
#       (run "p4 reviews" to see email addresses for all reviewers,
#       run "p4 user" to set email address)
#
# -> Problem: Multiple job notifications are sent
#
#     - the script should be run on the same machine as the Perforce
#       server; otherwise time differences between the two machines can
#       cause problems. This is because the job review mechanism uses a
#       timestamp. The change review mechanism uses change numbers, so
#       it's not affected by this problem.
